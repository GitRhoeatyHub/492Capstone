# 492Capstone
This is the final capstone project for CDS 492.
The goal of this project is to properly analyze tweets in the Twittersphere while assigning sentiment and polarity to those tweets. 
With these factors we will create code to create a sense of relation between someone's own tweet and something they might like.
The user will enter the topic of their own tweet and get many recomended tweets based on if they are looking for something to agree or disagree on.
The goal is to enusre that user's on Twitter are able to understand and get any piece of information they want while being able to converse or read freely on other people's opinions or ideas.
